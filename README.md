## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework

### What I learned

I used this project to continue getting more comfortable using Tailwind CSS which I feel like I am doing as I completed this solution quicker than any of the previous ones. I also played around with responsive design a little bit and learnt how Tailwind CSS handles it.

### Continued development

With the brief introduction to responsive design in this project and how Tailwind CSS handles that I want to continue building my confidence with responsive design, to that end I will choose projects that will allow me to achieve that.
